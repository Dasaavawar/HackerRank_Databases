# Index Architecture Types
# How many index architecture type classifications are there in MS SQL Server?

# (A) O 1
# (B) X 2
# (C) O 3
# (D) O 4


# Indexes - 2
# Which of the following statement is true about row locators in non-clustered indexes in MS SQL Server?

# (A) O If the table does not have a clustered index, the row locator is the clustered index key for the row.
# (B) O If the table has a clustered index, or the index is on an indexed view, the row locator is a pointer to the row.
# (C) X If the table has a clustered index, or the index is on an indexed view, the row locator is the clustered index key for the row.
# (D) O None of the above-mentioned statement is true.


# Indexes - 3
# Consider the following two designs to store the data using clustered indexes in MS SQL Server:

# - In the first design, the fill factor is 20% and the total number of free rows per page are A.
# - In the second design, the fill factor is 40% and the total number of free rows per page are B.

# Which the followings describes the relation between A and B:

# (A) X A = 1.33B
# (B) O B = 1.33A
# (C) O A = 0.67B
# (D) O B = 0.67A


# Indexes - 4
# The correct syntax for creating composite indexes in MS SQL Sever is:

# (A) O CREATE INDEX index_name; ON table_name(column1), table_name(column2);
# (B) O CREATE INDEX index_name; ON table_name(column1) and table_name(column2);
# (C) X CREATE INDEX index_name; ON table_name(column1, column2);
# (D) O All the above-mentioned syntax are correct.
